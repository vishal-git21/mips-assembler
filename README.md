# MIPS Assembler

This project is an assembler for a subset of MIPS instructions. It translates MIPS assembly language commands into their corresponding binary (machine code) values. The assembler is implemented in Python.

## Project Structure

- **instructions.s**: Contains MIPS assembly instructions to be encoded into binary values.
- **output.bin**: Contains the binary-encoded values of the instructions (generated by `Assembler.py`).
- **Assembler.py**: Reads assembly instructions from `instructions.s`, tokenizes them, and encodes them using `Encoder.py`. The binary output is written to `output.bin`.
- **Encoder.py**: Contains the logic to convert assembly instructions into their corresponding binary values.

## Supported Instructions

The following MIPS instructions are supported:

- `ADD`
- `SUB`
- `LW` (Load Word)
- `SW` (Store Word)
- `J` (Jump)

## How to Use

1. **Add Instructions**: Edit `instructions.s` to include the MIPS assembly instructions you want to encode.

2. **Run the Assembler**: Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python Assembler.py
    ```

   or, if using Python 3 explicitly:

    ```bash
    python3 Assembler.py
    ```

3. **View the Output**: The binary-encoded values will be saved in `output.bin`. This file will contain the machine code representations of your instructions.

## Example

Given the following content in `instructions.s`:

```plaintext
ADD R1, R2, R3
SUB R4, R5, R6
LW R7, 100(R8)
SW R9, 200(R10)
J 1000
```

After running `Assembler.py`, `output.bin` will contain the binary encodings for these instructions.
